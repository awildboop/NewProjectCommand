# New Project Command

New Project Command (NPC for short) allows you to initialize a new development project with a single command.
The following were strong considerations for the project's design:
- High configurability
- Simplistic use
- As lightweight as possible
- Easily expandable

I want to ensure that another developer can look at this project, understand what's going on, and make any changes they desire.
Similarly, I want people who simply want to install, change a few settings, and use it to do so without trouble.
